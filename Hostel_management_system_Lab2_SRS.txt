Hostel Management System
This system is designed in favor of the hostel management which helps them to save the records of the students about their rooms and other things. 
It helps them from the manual work from which it is very difficult to find the record of the students and the mess bills of the students, and the information of about the those ones who had left the hostel three years before. 
We design this system on the request of the hostel management, through this they cannot require so efficient person to handle and calculate the things. 
This system automatically calculates all the bills and issued the notifications for those students who are against some rules.
